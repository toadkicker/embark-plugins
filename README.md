# embark-plugins

This is a simple front end site for searching for embark plugins. It's under development right now.

## Setup

This bundle uses NPM to manage dependencies.

```
npm install
```

In `index.html` is `searchUrl` variable. Change this to 'npmsearch.com', but what I did was setup npmsearch locally and used that.

Then open index.html in a browser of your choice.
